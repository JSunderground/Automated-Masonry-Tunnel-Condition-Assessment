# Automated-Masonry-Tunnel-Condition-Assessment
Welcome to this repository that forms part of a project investigating automation techniques for masonry lined tunnel condition assessment. We have created an automated workflow that identifies the location of spalling serverity categories on a 3D masonry lined tunnel point cloud.  
Here we have uploaded a few useful visualisations:
  1.  A video walkthrough of the workflow is found at - https://clipchamp.com/watch/ZRNDN37PUaz
  2.  Local_Performance - This shows the output of the workflow
  3.  Spalling_assessment_workflow.png - This shows each stage of the 3D unspalled masonry face plane fitting stage of the workflow over three masonry blocks
OutputX.png - Here are some example synthetically generated masonry blocks used for training the neural networks.
