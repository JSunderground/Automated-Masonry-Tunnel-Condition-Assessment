# Automated-Masonry-Tunnel-Condition-Assessment
Welcome to this repository that forms part of a project investigating automation techniques for masonry lined tunnel condition assessment. We have created an automated workflow that identifies the location of spalling serverity categories on a 3D masonry lined tunnel point cloud.  
Here we have uploaded a few useful visualisations:
  1.  A video walkthrough of the workflow is shown in walkthrough
  2.  Spalling_assessment_workflow.png - This diagram shows the full psalling assessment workflow

For full details of the workflow, please see our publication:
